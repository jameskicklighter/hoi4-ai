# hoi4-ai
A mod that seeks to improve the functionality of the AI for the game Hearts of Iron IV.

The files are merely text files, but the process of modifying the game follows a set of rules. To implement the changes I have done so far, I have followed the instructions of the Hearts of Iron IV modding wiki, while also trying to understand the code myself.

This mod mainly improves the industrialization of certain AI nations, what focuses they choose, as well as some other small bonuses.
